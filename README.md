# Duckpod ver 3.0 (Autonomous Delivery Robot) Simulator (Updating README.md)

This project is about a Unity project that simulates movements of Duckpod URDF model.

If you hit the play button on the top, you can simulate the manual control of the robot.

* Key bindings
    * W (acceleration)
    * A (rotate left)
    * S (back acceleration)
    * D (rotate right)
    * Space (brake)

If the movements are out of normal, you can modify the frictions or suspensions of the wheel colliders.

You can also import other URDF model and simulate.
